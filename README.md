Hello random traveller ðŸ‘‹,

---
My name is Viet Bui, I'm currently a Senior at Augustana College majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 
I have experience in building Mathematical and Physics Simulation models in Python. I had the opportunity to publish my own individual research 
paper last year for a Tech Conference [check it out!](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9666740) and I am currently conducting another funded
Independent Research experience under Augustana's Math and Computer Science department's Chair and Beling Scholar Supervisor.
I am learning a lot in my research experiences, and I am still exploring my interests.

At the moment, I'm interested in building
Mobile Apps in Android Kotlin and Flutter. I am planning to learn Swift during this Winter to develop IOS applications.

My favorite hobbies outside of my academics are swimming, (table) tennis, playing video games, sorting my [Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/21zfnefkptclwec56htel2eei?si=7ec0d2d74ba4479d), cooking (meal-prepping to be exact), and mindlessly typing on my mechanical keyboard (currently holding a 120-wpm typing speed)

My languages and tools:
