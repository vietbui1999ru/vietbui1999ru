</br>
My name is Viet Bui. I'm currently a Senior at Augustana College majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 
</br>
I have experience in building Mathematical and Physics Simulation models in Python. I had the opportunity to publish my own individual research 
paper last year for a Tech Conference [check it out!](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9666740) and I am currently conducting another funded
Independent Research experience under Augustana's Math and Computer Science department's Chair and Beling Scholar Supervisor.
</br>
I have learnt a lot during my research experiences, and I am still learning and exploring my interests!
</br>
At the moment, I'm interested in building
Mobile Apps in Android Kotlin and Flutter.
</br>
I am planning to learn Swift during this Winter to develop IOS applications.
</br>

My favorite hobbies outside of my academics are swimming, (table) tennis, playing video games, sorting my [Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/21zfnefkptclwec56htel2eei?si=7ec0d2d74ba4479d), cooking (meal-prepping to be exact), and mindlessly typing on my mechanical keyboard (currently holding a 120-wpm typing speed)

My languages and tools:
